            <h2>What is Battlesnake?</h2>
            <p>
              A Battlesnake is a programmed web server that implements the <a href="/snake-api"
                target="_blank">Battlesnake HTTP API</a> to play the game snake against other Battlesnakes. When a game
              is running, the Battlesnake Game Engine will make HTTP requests to your server, sending you game
              information and asking for your next move.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1 - Build Your Snake</h2>
            <p>
              Select a technology you want to use to program your snake. Anything that can process a web request and be
              deployed to the internet will work.
              There are several <a href="/starter-snakes">Starter Snakes</a> that can be used as a base if you
              don't want to start from scratch. Each is built with a popular programming language and web application
              framework.

                Your Battlesnake must support 4 endpoints that will be called by the Game Engine:

                a Game ID that uniquely identifies which game the request is for. You should develop your snake to

            <p>
              Before your snake can do battle, it must be deployed to a publicly accessible server. This can be done
              using
              a
              cloud hosting provider such as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> or <a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>. Many of these services provide a
              free tier
              for
              deploying web servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the <a href="/starter-snakes">Starter Snakes</a> have instructions on how to deploy the snakes to
              a public Heroku instance so you can get started quickly.
