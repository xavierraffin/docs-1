We believe in the power of collaboration to make products great, so we want your help! We’ve got documentation that needs writing, bugs that need squashing, UI that needs designing, and more! If you are interested in helping to make Battlesnake better, there are many ways to help

#### Creating Starter Snakes
Although we have several different Starter Snakes demonstrating how to build snakes in different technologies, there are many other tech stacks out there that could be represented. We are always looking for new Community Starter Snakes that can help users start developing a Battlesnake.
When creating a new Starter Snake, make sure that you use the README TEMPLATE as a base for the README.md file of your project. Update it as necessary for the programming language and technology you are using in the starter snake.

#### Fixing Bugs & Writing Tests
Bugs will always exist with the system and we can always use help keeping things running optimally. We are also big believers in unit tests and good test coverage will make it easier to integrate future community contributions.

#### Writing Documentation
There is always a need for more documentation on Battlesnake whether it is a description of an algorithm or a new guide teaching someone how to deploy on a cloud platform. If you see some kind of documentation missing in the system or a mistake with some existing documentation feel free to contribute. 

#### New Features
Do you have an idea on how to make Battlesnake better? Is there a vital feature you noticed missing? Battlesnake is an evolving code base and we welcome these kind of contributions to the system. Even if you don't have any ideas, review the Github issues for the projects to see if there is something you want to work on.

### Open Source Projects

For our open source projects we use Github issues to keep track of improvements, bugs and enhancements. Feel free to create new issues for feature ideas you have or to flag bugs that you have seen in the system. The issues will be regularly reviewed and prioritized by Battlesnake staff and community members.

All of the open source projects for Battlesnake can be found on the [BattleSnake Official](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial) organization.

## A Few Tips for Writing Documentation
Our documentation lives [here in our docs repository](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/docs) as markdown files. We are always learning how to write better documentation for everyone, here are some tips we found useful for writing docs to get you started.


#### Informative and friendly
Feel free to write in a casual tone, we're all humans(except for the snake bots we build). Just don't forget: Being informative by presenting information in a clear and thoughtful manner is the most friendly act of all.

#### Avoid "easy", "simple", or "just..."
Whether something is easy depends on how much experience you have with the subject and we want our documentation be as inclusive as possible.

#### Use Descriptive Headers and Subheaders
Some people read every word, but others just want to scan for the information they need. Descriptive headers help anyone scanning the document by grouping information. Organizing your thoughts by starting with an outline of descriptive headers can also be a great way to start writing!

#### Add Images
Images are great for breaking up a wall of text, which helps make information easier to absorb. Images are also apparently worth 1000 words, so a good image can convey or reinforce what your documentation needs to get across to the reader.
